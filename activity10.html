            <p>It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences;
                 veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. 
                 Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. 
                 It was he who had been in the newspaper office when intelligence of the railroad disaster was received, 
                 with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of "killed."
                  He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram,
                   and had hastened to forestall any less careful, less tender friend in bearing the sad message</p>

        <h2>Two Military Executions</h2>
        <div class="frame-content">
            <p>In the spring of the year 1862 General Buell's big army lay in camp,
                 licking itself into shape for the campaign which resulted in the victory at Shiloh. 
                 It was a raw, untrained army, although some of its fractions had seen hard enough service,
                  with a good deal of fighting, in the mountains of Western Virginia, and in Kentucky. 
                  The war was young, and soldiering a new industry, imperfectly understood by the young American of the Period,
                   who found some features of it not altogether to his liking. Chief among these was that essential part of discipline, subordination.
                    To one imbued from infancy with the fascinating fallacy that all men are born equal,
                     unquestioning submission to authority is not easily mastered, and the American volunteer in his "green and salad days" is among the worst known.
                      That is how it happened that one of Buell's men, Private Bennett Story Greene, committed the indiscretion of striking his officer.
                       Later in the war he would not have done that; like Sir Andrew Aguecheek, he would have "seen him damned" first.
                        But time for reformation of his military manners was denied him: he was promptly arrested on complaint of the officer,
                         tried by court-martial and sentenced to be shot.</p>
