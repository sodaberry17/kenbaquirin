        <h2>The Wicked Prince</h2>
        <img src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/images/story/the-wicked-prince.avif" alt="Left Frame Image">
        <p>THERE lived once upon a time a wicked prince whose heart and mind were set upon conquering all the countries of the world,
             and on frightening the people; he devastated their countries with fire and sword,
              and his soldiers trod down the crops in the fields and destroyed the peasantsâ€™ huts by fire, 
              so that the flames licked the green leaves off the branches, and the fruit hung dried up on the singed black trees.
               Many a poor mother fled, her naked baby in her arms, behind the still smoking walls of her cottage; but also there the soldiers followed her,
                and when they found her, she served as new nourishment to their diabolical enjoyments; demons could not possibly have done worse things than these soldiers! 
                The prince was of opinion that all this was right, and that it was only the natural course which things ought to take. His power increased day by day, his name was feared by all, 
                and fortune favoured his deeds.</p>

        <h2>A Man with Two Lives </h2>
        <img src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/images/story/a-man-with-two-lives.avif" alt="Center Frame Image">
        <p>"In the autumn of 1866 I was a private soldier of the Eighteenth Infantry.
             My company was one of those stationed at Fort Phil Kearney, commanded by Colonel Carrington. 
             The country is more or less familiar with the history of that garrison,
              particularly with the slaughter by the Sioux of a detachment of eighty-one men and officers--not one escaping--through disobedience of orders by its commander, 
              the brave but reckless Captain Fetterman. When that occurred, I was trying to make my way with important dispatches to Fort C. F. Smith,
               on the Big Horn. As the country swarmed with hostile Indians, I traveled by night and concealed myself as best I could before daybreak. 
               The better to do so, I went afoot, armed with a Henry rifle and carrying three days' rations in my haversack.</p>

        <h2>The Kiss</h2>
        <img src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/images/story/the-kiss-chopin.avif" alt="Right Frame Image">
        <p>It was still quite light out of doors, but inside with the curtains drawn and the smouldering fire sending out a dim, uncertain glow, the room was full of deep shadows.

            Brantain sat in one of these shadows; it had overtaken him and he did not mind. 
            The obscurity lent him courage to keep his eves fastened as ardently as he liked upon the girl who sat in the firelight.</p>
